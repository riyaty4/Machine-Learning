The recent surge in the field of Machine Learning and development has attracted me towards observing massive explosion. During the years of undergraduate program, I worked for a couple of start-ups and events such as Hackathons which aim to serve as a platform to meet fellow developers and help in connecting with talented and motivated professionals. I am a Python Developer, and interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. I am presently interning at MyWays, IIT Delhi as Data Science Intern. Recently, I along with my team “MRDOTAPP” secured a significant position in Smart India Hackathon 2019 with organization “Future Generali”. We made an app which recognizes a person social profile using their professional photo and name only ... Also, I am currently working on a project “Extraction of data from newspaper” which involves the withdrawing of important news by the help of Machine Learning. This project has given me a lot of knowledge in the research areas related to Data Mining and related topics. Apart from the research and development field, I’m a Microsoft AI Rockstar for the session 2018, my duties include promoting the knowledge of Machine Learning and it’s uses for the future. I am also fortunate to be selected as a Dell Campassador for the upcoming session at MAIT. Also, I have been enrolled in Unity Affiliate Program too, where ... Along with this cutting-edge technical stuff, I also put in an extra effort in becoming a better and a well-rounded person. I have engaged myself in past in doing social and extracurricular activities by joining an NGO named “Leaders for Tomorrow”. I have been part of activities such as Anti-Drugs and Anti-Ragging Campaign, Cleanliness Drive, Adopt-APlant, etc. I have also been engaged in volunteering task and have inspired several students to take up social work and contribute to various development programmes. Regarding my near-term goal, I plan to intern with OPEN SOURCE CODE while leveraging my developer intellect. I am very excited at the prospect of devoting my skills to such a dynamic and fast advancing firm. My academic experience so far has provided me with a wide range of practical knowledge and skills that will be immensely useful while developing with Data.
